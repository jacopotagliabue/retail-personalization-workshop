# retail-personalization-workshop
Code for the In-Session Personalization workshop for eCommerce, April 2021

## Overview
This repo hosts the code for the [In-Session Personalization](https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/machine-learning-in-retail-sales-marketing-e-commerce-summit-tickets-138507063355) workshop at the _Machine Learning in Retail Summit_. The workshop is a hands-on meeting on in-session personalization, including slides and this open source repository: our aim is to implement a sound and readable version of the models found in our research papers, showcasing tried and tested personalization strategies on real e-commerce data.

While the notebook is heavily commented, please refer to the slides and the references below for the full context behind the product features and some design choices.

## How to run the code

### Setup
Make sure to install all the required dependencies, as listed in the `requirements.txt` file. Launch `jupyter notebook` and run the code as a standard notebook. 

### Data
The code works out of the box with the real-world dataset shared by Coveo for the [SIGIR Data Challenge 2021](https://github.com/coveooss/SIGIR-ecom-data-challenge): download the data, put it in a local folder, and then change the `LOCAL_FOLDER` variable in the notebook to point to the `train` folder in your computer. Remember that use of the Coveo dataset implies the acceptance of the accompanying T&C.

If you wish to use your own e-commerce data, all the "ML code" can be kept intact, as long as you replace the functions devoted to prepare session data from the training set.
